## Basic equations with homogeneous coordinates

### 2D

#### 1. point $p$ lies on line $l$
point $p$ ($p_x$, $p_y$, 1)  , which is the homogeneous coordinate of a 2d point

line $l$ ($a$, $b$, $c$)

We know that the normal vector $n$ of $l$ should be ($a$, $b$), and the slope and intercept of the line should be $-\frac{a}{b}$ and $-\frac{c}{b}$.

$p$ lies on $l$ <-> $p\cdot l=0$ <-> $p^{T}l=0$

#### 2. two lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ intersect at one point $p$
